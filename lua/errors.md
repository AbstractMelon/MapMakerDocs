# Errors

When a script encounters an error or fails to parse, it logs the error to the console.

- **Runtime Errors**: These specify the location in the code where the error occurred and which script was involved.
- **Parsing Errors**: These indicate where the error approximately happened during script parsing.

Use `print()` to log information to the console.

Example:
```lua
print("Debug message")
```
