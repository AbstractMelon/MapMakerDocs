# Map Maker UI

Map maker contains a very intuitive responsive UI system that helps the user efficiently create maps :)

## The Menu

### Clear
Clears the map *and* the map data (*name*, *description*, etc..), basically works just like closing and reopening the maker except its much easier :P

### Test
Opens the current map in bopl battle for you to test (especially useful for testing lua code).

If you use a program to open bopl battle with mods (r2modman etc..), you should press the *test* button only **after** opening Bopl Battle for it to work!

Otherwise, just pressing it would automatically open it with your current mod set.

### Save
Opens the [save dialogue](/finish.md)

### Load
Opens a file selection dialogue, pick the map you want to load in map maker and start remixing it! :)

### Lua
Opens the lua editor (a simple text editor), if you want a more sophisticated IDE, just edit the code on your preferred editor (vscode, visual studio, etc..) and when finished, copy the code to the text box inside the map maker.

### Settings
Opens the settings dialogue, the settings currently support configuration of:

* Theme: currently the only themes that exist are *'Light'* (default), *'Dark'*, and *'Bopl'*.
* Scale + Rotate: modify the key needed to swtich to the corresponding mode
* Default Dev: allows the user to pick a name that will automatically be used for the *Developer* field in [save dialogue](/finish.md#save-dialogue)

### Buy Us a Coffee
If you want to reward us with a donation for the months we spent working on this project for free out of love for the game and a desire to give back to the community, you are welcome to do so! we are so thankful! :D

If not, dont worry - you using our map creator is already rewarding for us! ultimately, that was our goal when making this, giving you - the community, a tool + system to use to exchange maps and further enjoy this amazing game, it has been a pleasure working on this :)
