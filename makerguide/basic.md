## The Sidebar

The sidebar is the inventory of the map maker, here are everything you need to build maps. 
It has platforms of every type! (switch types using the buttons on the left)

### Creating Platforms

To create a platform, just drag your platform of choice onto the world and voila!

* drag it back into the sidebar
* click it, and press `del`

## Platform Handling

Do you want to move your platform around? Scale it up or down? Rotate it however you want? Then that's exactly how you do these things:

### Moving Platforms

To move your platform, just drag it and plop it wherever you want it to be. That's it!

### Scaling/Rotating Platforms

  <p>To scale/rotate your platform, start with hovering it with the mouse. See that box in the middle? If it's white, that means you are in **scaling mode**. If it's black, you are in **rotating mode**. To switch between them, press `s` for scaling, and `r` for rotating.</p>
