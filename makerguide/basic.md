# The Sidebar

The sidebar is the inventory of the map maker, containing everything you need to build awesome maps.
It has platforms of every type! (switch types using the buttons on the left)

Okay lets say you created a platform which you don't want anymore, there are two simple ways to remove it completely:

* Click it, and press `del`

# The Marker

Hover over your platform with the mouse, see that box in the middle? that's the marker.

If it's white that means you are in **scaling mode**,
if it's black, you are in **rotating mode**.

::: info Switching between the two is easy, just perss `s` to enter scaling mode and `r` for rotating mode.

To scale a platform, just hover it and drag the marker to resize.
* **upwards** = increase scale
* **downwards** = decrease scale

::: tip
If you want to scale the platform not arbitrarily, just hold down `shift` while scaling and the scale will increase/decrease by multiples of 0.1

## Rotating Platforms

To rotate a platform, just hover it and drag the marker around, the platform will face your cursor as long as the marker is visible.

::: tip
If you want to rotate the platform not arbitrarily, just hold down `shift` while rotating and the rotation will inch by 15 angle multiples while rotating.
